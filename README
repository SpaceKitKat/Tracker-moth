This file describes how to use the moth_tracker executable to generate
tracked moth trajectories.
Notation description:
	The command templates given use <> to denote what arguments the
user should pass to the program -- like place holders. Do not include the
<> symbols in the arguments that you pass.

Dependencies:
  opencv library
    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV
  boost library
    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev


After downloading "moth_tracker":
  check permissions
    $ l -l moth_tracker
  make sure the output looks like
   -rwxrwxrwx ... moth_tracker
  if it doesn't, then run
    $ sudo chmod 777 moth_tracker

Before running "moth_tracker":
  make sure that the aforementioned dependencies are installed on your
machine

Running "moth_tracker":
  (A) default - does not display video output, does not perform dedistortion
    $ ./moth_tracker <input_VIDEO_FILE_path> <output_TEXT_FILE_path>
    To specifying file paths,
	if file is in same dir as "moth_tracker", use ./<file>
	otherwise, use ~/<file_path> to reference from home
	or use //<file_path> to reference from root (this is useful when
accessing peripherals)

  (B) toggle undistortion and toggle visualization
  NOTE: options should be passed AFTER initial arguments
    # this command will display video and output undistorted xy-data
    $ ./moth_tracker <input_VIDEO_FILE_path> <output_TEXT_FILE_path> -d 1
    or
    $ ./moth_tracker <input_VIDEO_FILE_path> <output_TEXT_FILE_path> --dedistort 1
	Note that these arguments are sensitive to order and white space, so follow
these examples closely.
